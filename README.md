#KVL Flash Cards

Windows flash card application for learning addition and multiplication math facts. It keeps track of each user's best time on each deck so they can work to improve.

Decks can be edited and configured through the app.config file.

An installer is included (\Installer\Output\KVL Installer.exe) if you don't want to build the source.

The only prerequisite is the [.NET 4.0 Client Profile](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17113).
